  [33X[0;0YThe  main  features  of  the  library  can be summarized in three points: it
  provides a complete set of semigroups up to isomorphism and anti-isomorphism
  of  sizes up to 8; it carries a vast amount of precomputed information about
  these  semigroups;  and  there  is  an identification function which takes a
  semigroup  with  at  most 8 elements and returns a map to the equivalent one
  from the library.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThese features lead to different ways of using the library. It is impossible
  to  describe  -  or  even  to anticipate - all possible types of usage. Most
  problems  will  admit  multiple  solutions.  We find it difficult to predict
  which  will  be  most effective. The examples in this chapter should give an
  idea  of  the  differences  in the various functions and help you to find an
  alternative  if  a  computation  uses  more  time  or  memory  than you have
  available.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YLet  us  go  step by step through some ways to use the library showing which
  tools are provided.[133X

  [33X[0;0YAt  first  one could want to search through the stored semigroups for one or
  all semigroups with a certain property. Going through all the semigroups can
  take  a  long time. Just to create all the 1.8 billion semigroups as objects
  in  [5XGAP[105X  takes  around  a day on a modern PC. Doing a simple test on all the
  semigroups  in  the  library  might take another day. Performing complicated
  tests  easily  takes weeks. To avoid this, many properties of the semigroups
  were  precomputed.  Semigroups with or without a precomputed property can be
  accessed  as quickly as simply creating the same number of semigroups. (Note
  that  timings  of  two  calls  to  the same command may vary and, of course,
  heavily depend on your machine.)[133X

  [33X[0;0YObserve  that  in  the  last  example the semigroup from the enumerator knew
  about  the  property  that was used to create the enumerator. The enumerator
  stores this knowledge and passes it on whenever a member is called.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAnother  reason to prefer an enumerator is that one might only be interested
  in some of the elements it contains. This could become clear after analysing
  some  of  the  elements  and  then  there  is no time wasted in creating all
  semigroups  in the enumerator. Or possibly creating the enumerator involving
  precomputed  properties was just the first step. As described in Section [14X4.3[114X
  enumerators  themselves can be given as argument to get to a more restricted
  class of semigroups. This leads us to the next part of this section.[133X

  ([14X4.3-11[114X)  interesting  again.  Assume  you  want  to work with bands ([2XIsBand[102X

  semigroup for this combination of properties.[133X

  [33X[0;0YObserve  that  the  enumerator  lost  its  advantage of returning the answer
  faster because not all properties are precomputed. Thus all bands have to be
  constructed  to  test  their  number  of  [22XD[122X-classes.  As  the number of such
  semigroups is small, [2XAllSmallSemigroups[102X ([14X4.3-1[114X) is the better choice in this
  example  -  remember  that  the  semigroups  from  the enumerator have to be
  recreated  in  every  call.  Often  one does not have this kind of knowledge
  beforehand.  Even  for a large number of semigroups the enumerator still has
  the  advantage  of  using  far  less memory as it stores only the IDs of the
  semigroups. Before explaining more about this let us for a moment go back to
  the  semigroups  from  the  previous  example.  It  turns out they are the 2
  non-equivalent   rectangular   bands  ([2XIsRectangularBand[102X  ([14X4.2-21[114X))  with  8

  [33X[0;0YHowever,  we  would  like  to  include the semigroups of order 8 as well. As

  helpful.  The description of [2XNilpotencyRank[102X ([14X4.2-33[114X) contains information on
  the  IDs  of  all  3-nilpotent  semigroups  of  order  8.  We  can create an

  [33X[0;0YYou  can  avoid the waiting time at setup by using an iterator instead of an
  enumerator. An iterator does not know how many elements it contains, one can
  always  just  access  the  next element - if such exists - and one cannot go
  back. (Making copies of an iterator can help to circumvent this problem.) On
  the  other hand one could in the above example start investigating the first
  couple of elements right away.[133X

  [33X[0;0YBut  even  if  you  know  you  want  to  inspect all the semigroups having a
  property  which  is  not  precomputed, an iterator has the advantage that it
  does  not  create  the semigroups before you can actually work with them. To
  create  an  enumerator  all  semigroups in question will be created and - as
  said before - every element is created anew when it is accessed. An iterator
  on  the other hand creates the semigroups in question one-by-one and returns
  the  next one having the property. This makes a big difference if the number
  of  semigroups  one  is  interested  in  is  big  like in the example of not
  nilpotent  semigroups  of size 8. In the former example with the rectangular
  bands  it  would  not play a role and the disadvantages of an iterator would
  prevail.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAs  you  can see the number of semigroups you are interested in is even more
  important  in the case of user defined functions than it was in the previous
  section  about precomputed properties. Sometimes you might have a rough idea
  about  the  numbers  -  or  even  a  very good one - to base your choice on.
  Otherwise  the best approach seems to consist of two steps. First, create an
  enumerator involving all precomputed properties (try to find as many implied
  properties  as  possible).  Then  work with an iterator, call the semigroups
  one-by-one  and store them in a separate list if you think you might want to
  look at them again at a later stage.[133X

  [33X[0;0YWhen using enumerators and iterators of semigroups of order 8 there are some
  limitations.  In a 32-bit system the number of semigroups of order 8 exceeds
  the  maximal  length  of  a list in [5XGAP[105X. The following will work in a 64-bit
